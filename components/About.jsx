        About Me
      </h2>
      <div className="flex flex-col  gap-6">
        <p>
          Guided by a passion for problem-solving, I'm a developer who deeply
          appreciates the profound impact of technology in today's world. My
          primary focus is on using technology to create innovative applications
          and software that not only simplify daily life but also make it more
          enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my leisure time, you'll find me watching educational TV shows and
          sitcoms. I'm also passionate about music, where I enjoy playing the
          piano and singing along. I make a point of attending tech events and
          other social gatherings to expand my network and meet new people.
          Currently, I'm developing a reading habit, and I'm excited to see
          where it takes me. ðŸ˜„ Wish me luck!
